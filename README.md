# Projections site

_TODO: "Projections" doesn't accurately describe the data we can make more
accessible. Neither does CRS; I expect to be able to display full projected
CRSes, geographic CRSes, datums, ellipsoids, spheroids, etc. What do we call
that class of things?_

A site like epsg.io with rich information about data in the Proj database,
except it's updated automatically.
